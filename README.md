Cloud Engineering Capstone Project 
# Static Website Deployment on AWS S3 & CloudFront
# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a static website using Amazon S3 for storage and CloudFront as a Content Delivery Network (CDN). The setup ensures high availability, low latency, and secure content delivery.

# Architecture
Amazon S3 Hosts the static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)

Amazon CloudFront: CDN service that caches content at edge locations for faster global access

Bucket Policy: Configures public read access to S3 objects

# Prerequisites
AWS Account with appropriate permissions

Static website files (at minimum an index.html file)

GitHub account for version control

Basic understanding of AWS console
